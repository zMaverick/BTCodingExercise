Instructions for Use:

1. Either Build or Debug the solution in visual studio creating an .exe file 
2. In the console (cmd) navigate to the location of the .exe file using the cd command (change directory)
3. If using the debug to create the .exe, the file will be located in the \BTCodeExercise\BTCodeExercise\bin\Debug\ folder
4. Run the file from the cmd with the names to be checked as arguments separated by spaces (for example: C:\...\filelocation>BTCodeExercise.exe arg1 arg2)
5. Input the names manually (15 Max) one per line, or use a text file (for example: C:\...\filelocation>BTCodeExercise.exe arg1 arg2 < inputnames.txt)
6. The matching  names will be output to the console at the bottom

Note: A list of 15 surnames in a text file is located in the Debug folder for use
